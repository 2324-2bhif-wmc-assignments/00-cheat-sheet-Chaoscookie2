        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <h2>CSS Rule</h2>
        <p>
            A CSS rule consists of the selector <span class="notes">like an element or a class</span> and a declaration in curved brackets.
            Multiple selectors can be used by like this: h1, h2, p {declaration}
        </p>

        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>
            Comments start with /* and end with */
        </p>

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>
            the color: property can be used to change the color of many things like text or background, using either predefined names or hex codes
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Using the background property you can implement background color and images
            with the background-repeat property you can make the image repeat only along one axis or not at all
            using the background-position property you can set a fixed position of an image
        </p>
        <h2>Text</h2>
        <p>
            With the color property you can change the color of text. With the text-align property, the text can be aligned
            in the center, right or left. With text-align: justify; you can create block text. Using the text-decoration-line property you can add
            decorations like underlines. You can also color them using text-decoration-color. The text-transform property is used to specify uppercase and lowercase letters in a text.
        </p>
        <h2>Fonts</h2>
        <p>
            Serif fonts have small strokes at the end of each letter, Sans serif fonts don't. You can change the font with the font-family property.
            The font-style property is used to make text italic. The font-size attribute can change font size either in pixels or with em
            <span class="notes">this takes the current font size of the browser as base, which by default is 16px</span>. font-weight is used to make text bold.
        </p>
        <h2>Links</h2>
        <p>
            Links can be styled with the a:link, a:visited, a:hover and a:activate selectors.
        </p>
        <h2>Combinators</h2>
        <p>

            Using combinators you can select elements that have a certain relationship to other elements. <br>
            "space" : descendant selector, selects all elements of a type, an element of the first type <br>
            ">" : child selector, selects all <b>direct</b> descendants of a type that, that are within an element with the first type
            <br>
            "+" : adjacent sibling selector, selects elements of a type, that are directly under an element of the first type
            <br>
            "~" : general sibling selector, selects elements of a type, that are under or above an element of the first type
            example:
        </p>
        <pre>
{
    background-color: yellow;
}
        </pre>
        <h2>Pseudo Classes</h2>
        <p>
            A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. Written directly after the selector, common pseudo classes include:
            :link, :visited, :activated for the "a" tag, and :hover which also works for different ones. The :first-child pseudo-class selects an element,
            that is the first child of the selected tag <span class="notes">for example p:first-child selects the first child in ever paragraph</span>
        </p>
