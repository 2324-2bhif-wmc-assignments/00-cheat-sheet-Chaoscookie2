                <h2>The World Wide Web</h2>
                <h1>General</h1>
                <p>
                    The world wide web was founded by Tim Berners-Lee, and was meant to be a decentralized file system
                    with links between different databases on independent computers. The most important
                    technologies to make this work are html, url and html.
                </p>
                <h1>HTML</h1>
                <p>
                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to form the base structure and content of a website.
                </p>
                <h1>URL</h1>
                <p>
                    A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used by web clients to send HTTP requests to
                    web servers. A URL's syntax typically looks like a URI (Uniform Resource Locator),
                    which look like this:"[scheme]://[authority]/[path]?[query]#[fragment]".
                </p>
                <h1>HTTP</h1>
                <p>
                    (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the primary protocol, by web servers and web clients
                    to transfer hypertext. The secured version of it is called HTTPS.
                </p>
                <h1>Web Server</h1>
                <p>
                    Web Servers are what make up the entire World Wide Web. They can receive HTTP request and
                    can then send back either static content in the form of a preexisting file, or dynamic content
                    which a web client can use to generate something like an HTML file on the fly.
                </p>
                <h1>Web Client</h1>
                <p>
                    Web clients, also commonly known as browsers, are a way for people to access websites.
                    When the user inputs a URL, the client sends an HTTP request to the specified server, and
                    display the received resources.
