                    The world wide web was founded by Tim Berners-Lee, and was meant to be a decentralized file system
                    with links between different databases on independent computers. The most important
                    technologies to make this work are html, url and html.
                </p>
                <h1>HTML</h1>
                <p>
                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to form the base structure and content of a website.
                </p>
                <h1>URL</h1>
                <p>
                    A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used by web clients to send HTTP requests to
                    web servers. A URL's syntax typically looks like a URI (Uniform Resource Locator),
                    which look like this:"[scheme]://[authority]/[path]?[query]#[fragment]".
                </p>
                <h1>HTTP</h1>
                <p>
                    (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the primary protocol, by web servers and web clients
                    to transfer hypertext. The secured version of it is called HTTPS.
