            <h2>General</h2>
            <p>
                The world wide web was founded by Tim Berners-Lee, and was meant to be a decentralized file system
                with links between different databases on independent computers. The most important
                technologies to make this work are <a href="#HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="#URL">URL</a> and <a
                    href="#HTTP">HTTP</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 id="HTML">HTML</h2>
            <p>

                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to form the base structure and content of a website.
            </p>
            <h2 id="URL">URL</h2>
            <p>
                A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used by web clients to send HTTP requests to
                web servers. A URL's syntax typically looks like a URI (Uniform Resource Locator),
                which look like this:"[scheme]://[authority]/[path]?[query]#[fragment]".
            </p>
            <h2 id="HTTP">HTTP</h2>
            <p>
                (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the primary protocol, by web servers and web clients
                to transfer hypertext. The secured version of it is called HTTPS.
            </p>
            <h2>Web Server</h2>
            <p>
                Web Servers are what make up the entire World Wide Web. They can receive HTTP request and
                can then send back either static content in the form of a preexisting file, or dynamic content
                which a web client can use to generate something like an HTML file on the fly.
            </p>
            <h2>Web Client</h2>
            <p>
                Web clients, also commonly known as browsers, are a way for people to access websites.
                When the user inputs a URL, the client sends an HTTP request to the specified server, and
                display the received resources.
